# Junzi-Liuyi

First Draft
Nov. 26, 2019
The interactive website of Junzi Liuyi is created by Yuxin & Shuyue. We have explored different game-like mechanics with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but still need to work on accurate alignment and make improvements in interactive events and UI (75% done by now).

Yuxin is responsible for the index page, ceremony page, archery page and calligraphy page.
Problems that have not been fixed are listed as follows:
1. [Archery] The movement of arrows is covered by the target board.
2. [Ceremony] The flipping effect of the pages cannot be successfully triggered by "click" event.
3. [Ceremony] The alignment and sequence of pictures are problematic.

Shuyue is responsible for the music page, ride page and math page.
